1. Anna and I collaborated on the code by verbally discussing first and took turns dictating/writing code
for pair coding. We looked at various options for programming othello, and solving it in different ways and 
optimized the functions.

2. We attempted various ideas for playing othello. We successfully implemented heuristic, then considered
methods to pick spots based on weight, chance, and length.
